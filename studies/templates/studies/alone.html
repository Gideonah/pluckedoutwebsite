<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span >Often men look up into space and wonder are we all there is? From an atheistic world view this question would be valid considering the chances of producing life through evolution is zero. However, from a theistic standpoint do we really believe that God created all that is seen and unseen and with infinite power decided to only create one planet filled with life? Did he create all those planets and stars just to be empty and void?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><u><span>Isaiah 45:18</span></u><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong><span>For</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>thus saith the</span><span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-variant:small-caps; background-color:#ffffff;">Lord</span></strong><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>that</span></strong><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>created</span></strong><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>the heavens</span></strong><span>; God himself that</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>formed the earth and made</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>it; he hath established</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>it,&nbsp;</span><strong><span>he</span></strong><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>created</span></strong><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>it not</span></strong><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>in vain</span></strong><span>,&nbsp;</span><strong><span>he</span></strong><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>formed</span></strong><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>it</span></strong><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>to</span></strong><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>be</span></strong><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>inhabited</span></strong><span>:</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>I</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>am the</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-variant:small-caps; background-color:#ffffff;">Lord</span><span>; and there</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>is none else.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span>In this study we will not imply that because God made planet earth with life, therefore if he created other planets with life. Rather we will use scripture to prove this point.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><u><span >Isaiah 28:10</span></u><strong><span >&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span >For precept must be upon precept</span></strong><span >,&nbsp;</span><strong><span >precept upon precept</span></strong><span >; line upon line, line upon line;&nbsp;</span><strong><span >here a little, and there a little</span></strong><span >.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span >As Isaiah 28:10 makes it clear precept must be upon precept and we need to go back and forth through scripture to find out what every scripture says on a certain topic. To prove the point of this study we need to understand the term the &ldquo;sons of God&rdquo;. Due to a large misunderstanding of the term, many Christians have been led to believe that sons of God is a term that relates to angels. This is false. We can show it to actually be contradictory in many points biblically.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-align:center;"><u><span >Who are the &ldquo;sons of God&rdquo;?</span></u></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><u><span >Genesis 6:2,4</span></u><span >&nbsp;&ldquo;That&nbsp;</span><strong><span >the sons of God</span></strong><span >&nbsp;saw&nbsp;</span><strong><span >the daughters of men</span></strong><span >&nbsp;that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose. 4</span><span >&nbsp;</span><strong><span >There were giants in the earth in those days</span></strong><span >; and also after that, when&nbsp;</span><strong><span >the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men</span></strong><span >, and&nbsp;</span><strong><span >they bare children to them</span></strong><span >, the same became mighty men which were of old,&nbsp;</span><strong><span >men of renown</span></strong><span >&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span >Typically, there is a belief that these &ldquo;sons of God&rdquo; are either fallen angels or Nephilim. The word giants comes from the Hebrew word &ldquo;nāp̄&icirc;l&rdquo; (strong&rsquo;s H5303) it simply means just that a giant. An extra definition of &ldquo;Nephilim&rdquo; is added but that&rsquo;s not the direct translation. The first point the bible is trying to teach is that men were larger in the days before the flood. The second point is that the word speaks to the nature of these men too. The etomology of the word comes from the Hebrew word &ldquo;nāp̄al&rdquo; (strong&rsquo;s H5307) which means a bully or a tyrant. The last point is that they were &ldquo;men of renown&rdquo;. A man of renown is someone that&rsquo;s well known, today we call them celebrities. This is no surprise because how did Jesus compare our day to Noah&rsquo;s?&nbsp;</span><u><span >Luke 17:26</span></u><span >&nbsp;&ldquo;And&nbsp;</span><strong><span >as it was in the days of Noe</span></strong><span >,&nbsp;</span><strong><span >so shall it be also</span></strong><span >&nbsp;in the&nbsp;</span><strong><span >days of the Son of man</span></strong><span >&rdquo;. Society today matches Noah&rsquo;s society. We don&rsquo;t have literal giants, but we have tyrants and celebrities. Furthermore, notice how after the flood there are still giants even though the flood was meant to wipe them all out. Numbers 13:33 &ldquo;</span><strong><span >And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak</span></strong><span >, which come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span >Numbers is written more than six hundred years after the flood. We have a problem, if giants need to be descendants of angels sleeping with men. Why doesn&rsquo;t the bible mention this happening after the flood? In fact, we have clear genealogies from 1 chronicles for men after the flood. There&rsquo;s no mention of the sons of God &ldquo;coming into&rdquo; the daughters of men after that. Yet, we still get giants. It seems we don&rsquo;t need these certain &ldquo;sons of God&rdquo; to produce be giants. After all the tallest man in the past one hundred years was 8ft 11 in&nbsp;</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Wadlow" style="text-decoration:none;"><u><span>Robert waldo</span></u></a><span >&nbsp;and his parents were normal size.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-align:center;"><u><span >Can we prove that &ldquo;sons of Gods&rdquo; can&rsquo;t be angels?</span></u></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span >In Genesis 6 it mentions something very key that the sons of God do&nbsp;</span><u><span >Genesis 6:2,4</span></u><span >&nbsp;&ldquo;That the&nbsp;</span><strong><span >sons of God</span></strong><span >&nbsp;saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they&nbsp;</span><strong><span >took them wives of all&nbsp;</span></strong><span >which they chose.</span><u><span >&nbsp;4</span></u><span >&nbsp;</span><span >There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the&nbsp;</span><strong><span >sons of God</span></strong><span >&nbsp;came in unto the&nbsp;</span><strong><span >daughters of men</span></strong><span >, and they&nbsp;</span><strong><span >bare children</span></strong><span >&nbsp;to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown&rdquo;. The scripture is clear they took wives and had children. This actually contradicts what Jesus said about the nature of angels. Matthew 22:30 &ldquo;For in the resurrection</span><span >&nbsp;</span><strong><span >they</span></strong><span >&nbsp;</span><strong><span >neither</span></strong><span >&nbsp;</span><strong><span >marry</span></strong><span >,&nbsp;</span><strong><span >nor&nbsp;</span></strong><span >are given in&nbsp;</span><strong><span >marriage</span></strong><span >,&nbsp;</span><strong><span >but are as the angels of God</span></strong><span >&nbsp;in heaven..</span><span >.&rdquo; Jesus told us plainly, angels don&rsquo;t marry! In fact Jesus mentions that it is the children of&nbsp;</span><strong><span >this world</span></strong><span >&nbsp;that marry.&nbsp;</span><u><span >Luke 20:34-36</span></u><strong><span >&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span >&ldquo;</span></strong><span >And Jesus answering said unto them,&nbsp;</span><strong><span >The children of this world marry</span></strong><span >, and&nbsp;</span><strong><span >are given in marriage</span></strong><span >:</span><u><span >35</span></u><strong><span >&nbsp;</span></strong><span >But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead,&nbsp;</span><strong><span >neither marry, nor are given in marriage</span></strong><span >:</span><u><span >&nbsp;36</span></u><strong><span >&nbsp;</span></strong><span >Neither can they die any more:&nbsp;</span><strong><span >for they are equal unto the angels</span></strong><span >; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection&rdquo;. If being equal to the angels means we do not marry any more then it would stand to reason that we cannot assume the &ldquo;sons of God&rdquo; refer to angels. Furthermore, if one wanted to argue that &ldquo;maybe because they are fallen angels now they marry&rdquo; this still would contradict the bible. We will show this.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-align:center;"><u><span >Can we prove that the &ldquo;sons of God&rdquo; refers to humans?</span></u></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span >It&rsquo;s very simple to show who are sons of God. All one has to do is present the scriptures:&nbsp;</span><u><span >John 1:12</span></u><span >&nbsp;&ldquo;But&nbsp;</span><strong><span >as many as received him</span></strong><span >,&nbsp;</span><strong><span >to them gave he power to become</span></strong><span >&nbsp;the</span><span >&nbsp;</span><strong><span >sons</span></strong><span >&nbsp;</span><strong><span >of</span></strong><span >&nbsp;</span><strong><span >God</span></strong><span >,</span><span >&nbsp;</span><em><span >even</span></em><span >&nbsp;</span><span >to them that believe on his name&rdquo;. Do demons receive Christ? No! So how can fallen angels ever take the title &ldquo;sons of God&rdquo;? It&rsquo;s an absolute contradiction. In two points! These sons of God marry, angels can&rsquo;t marry. These sons of God receive Christ, fallen angels don&rsquo;t receive Christ. Rom 8:14 &ldquo;For&nbsp;</span><strong><span >as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God</span></strong><span >&rdquo;. The sons of God are led by the Holy Spirit, fallen angels aren&rsquo;t led by the Holy Spirit! There are three clear points of contradiction whilst at the same time showing sons of God are obedient human beings following Christ and even the Holy spirit!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-align:center;"><u><span >Are we the &ldquo;sons of God&rdquo;?</span></u></p>

<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><u><span >1 John 3:1</span></u><span >&nbsp;&ldquo;Behold, what manner</span><span >&nbsp;</span><span >of</span><span >&nbsp;</span><span >love the Father hath bestowed upon us,&nbsp;</span><strong><span >that we should be called the</span></strong><strong><span >&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span >sons</span></strong><strong><span >&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span >of</span></strong><strong><span >&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span >God</span></strong><span >: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not Beloved, now&nbsp;</span><strong><span >are we the sons of God</span></strong><span >, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that,&nbsp;</span><strong><span >when he shall appear, we shall be like him</span></strong><span >; for we shall see him as he is&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span >So far it appears we don&rsquo;t need to be descendants of fallen angels to receive the title &ldquo;sons of God&rdquo; but rather it&rsquo;s a title of obedience to God.&nbsp;</span><u><span >1 John 3:9-10</span></u><strong><span >&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span >&ldquo;</span></strong><span >Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.&nbsp;</span><u><span >10</span></u><strong><span >&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span >In this the children of God are manifest</span></strong><span >, and&nbsp;</span><strong><span >the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God</span></strong><span >, neither he that loveth not his brother&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span >To be a child of God and by extension one of his &ldquo;sons&rdquo; you need to not sin, once again fallen angels sinned! So, who was God talking about when the sons of God married the daughters of men? This was merely to represent the obedient children of God marrying those who chose to not believe in God. We see the descendants of Seth were obedient. To the point that Adam was called a &ldquo;son of God&rdquo;.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span >Luke 3:38 &ldquo;Which was</span><span >&nbsp;</span><span >the son</span><span >&nbsp;</span><span >of Enos,&nbsp;</span><strong><span >which was</span></strong><strong><span >&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span >the son</span></strong><strong><span >&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span >of Seth,</span></strong><span >&nbsp;which was</span><span >&nbsp;</span><span >the son</span><span >&nbsp;</span><span >of Adam,&nbsp;</span><strong><span >which was</span></strong><strong><span >&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span >the son</span></strong><strong><span >&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span >of God</span></strong><span >. We have proof that sons of God refer to humans and you only get that title once you obey. God knew the result of his children marrying with the disobedient and hence why he commanded the children of Israel not to marry other heathen nations&rdquo;.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:14pt; margin-bottom:14pt; background-color:#ffffff;"><span >The Lord commanded them to marry out of safety as we saw what happened in Noah&rsquo;s day. The evil daughters corrupted the good men leading to more evil children. To the point where everyone was evil! In Israel a stranger had to be converted and join the congregation before you could marry them. Now that we understand who gets the title of the &ldquo;sons of God&rdquo; we can finally answer the original question. Are we alone?</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span>There were already humans alive shouting in existence while the earth was being created. Do these humans need their own planets to live on? Did Jesus create one world or multiple?</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><u><span>Hebrews 11:3</span></u><span>&nbsp;Through faith we understand that&nbsp;</span><strong><span>the worlds</span></strong><span>&nbsp;were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span>The scripture doesn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;world&rdquo; it says &ldquo;worlds&rdquo; plural. Let&rsquo;s get another witness.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><u><span>Hebrews 1:2</span></u><span>&nbsp;Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made&nbsp;</span><strong><span>the worlds</span></strong><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span>The scriptures are very clear God has other sons of God, who shouted for joy when our planet was being created. They all live on their own worlds. A few quick points:</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-align:center;"><u><span>Where are stars located?</span></u></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><u><span>Psalm 8:3</span></u><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;When I consider&nbsp;</span><strong><span>thy heavens</span></strong><span>, the work of thy fingers,&nbsp;</span><strong><span>the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained</span></strong><span>&rdquo;. The moon and stars are in the heavens. Today we call the heavens: space. However, notice what&rsquo;s said in&nbsp;</span><u><span>Revelation 12:12</span></u><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;Therefore rejoice,&nbsp;</span><strong><span>ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them</span></strong><span>. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil&nbsp;</span><strong><span>is come down unto you</span></strong><span>, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span>If the heavens are where the stars are, who dwells in the heavens (space)? It&rsquo;s very clear the Lord did not create this vast universe to have one planet inhabited with life. For us obedient Christians we have brothers and sisters who have not fallen. Unfortunately, we are the only planet that have fallen, and we know this because they still retain the title &ldquo;sons of God&rdquo;. You may be thinking &ldquo;man I wish I was born over there and not here&rdquo;, but when the Lord recreates this planet, the new Jerusalem, where God&rsquo;s throne is located, will descent to this new planet (earth recreated)! Hence planet earth will be the capital of the universe!</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:14pt; margin-bottom:14pt; background-color:#ffffff;"><u><span >Revelation 21:1-3</span></u><strong><span >&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span >&ldquo;</span></strong><span >And I saw&nbsp;</span><strong><span >a new heaven and a new earth</span></strong><span >: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.&nbsp;</span><u><span >2</span></u><u><span >&nbsp;</span></u><span >And I John saw the holy city,&nbsp;</span><strong><span >new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven</span></strong><span >, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.&nbsp;</span><u><span >3</span></u><strong><span >&nbsp;</span></strong><span >And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold,&nbsp;</span><strong><span >the tabernacle of God is with men</span></strong><span >, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and&nbsp;</span><strong><span >God himself shall be with them</span></strong><span >, and&nbsp;</span><strong><span >be their God&rdquo;</span></strong><span >.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span>Notice the new Jerusalem comes out of where? Heaven! It doesn&rsquo;t come out of another dimension.&nbsp;</span><span >Isaiah 64:4&nbsp;</span><strong><span >For since the beginning of the world men have not heard</span></strong><span >, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee,&nbsp;</span><strong><span >what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him</span></strong><span >.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-align:center;"><u><span >Extra: How did Satan come among the &ldquo;sons of God&rdquo;?</span></u></p>
<p style="margin-top:14pt; margin-bottom:14pt; background-color:#ffffff;"><u><span >Job 1:6</span></u><span >&nbsp;</span><span >&ldquo;</span><strong><span >Now there was a day when the sons of God</span></strong><span >&nbsp;came to present themselves before the</span><span >&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span >, and&nbsp;</span><strong><span >Satan came also among them</span></strong><span >.</span><span >&nbsp;</span><u><span >7</span></u><span >&nbsp;</span><span >And the</span><span >&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span >&nbsp;</span><span >said unto Satan,&nbsp;</span><strong><span >Whence comest thou</span></strong><span >? Then Satan answered the</span><span >&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Calibri; font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span >, and said, From going to and fro&nbsp;</span><strong><u><span >in the earth</span></u></strong><span >, and from walking up and down in it&rdquo;. As we know sons of God are humans, essentially this was a gathering of obedient humans in the past, today we call it church. Satan came to spy and take notes. Not many are aware, but Satan constantly stalks believers when they congregate and that&rsquo;s what the book of Job is trying to show. He&rsquo;s constantly walking about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour. We have a concrete example of this in&nbsp;</span><u><span >Luke 4:33</span></u><span >&nbsp;&ldquo;And&nbsp;</span><strong><span >in the synagogue</span></strong><span >&nbsp;there was a man,&nbsp;</span><strong><span >which had a spirit of an unclean devil,</span></strong><span >&nbsp;and cried out with a loud voice&rdquo;. The possessed man was able to gather with the other believers. Nothing physically stops Satan from spying out the congregation. Unless the Lord explicitly halts it. The reason why he&rsquo;s talking to God is because the Lord is always there where at least two or three witnesses are gathered in his name. Matthew 18:20 &ldquo;For&nbsp;</span><strong><span >where two or three are gathered</span></strong><span >&nbsp;together in my name,&nbsp;</span><strong><span >there am I in the midst of them</span></strong><span >&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s no wonder the Lord is talking to Satan they&rsquo;re both there in the congregation. The reason the Lord then brings up Job is because Job was also there in the congregation. So as Job is gathering with his brethren the Lord points out Job amongst the midst of all the believers who gathered in his name. He was one of the strongest Christians of the congregation.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:14pt; margin-bottom:14pt; background-color:#ffffff;"><u><span >Job 1:8</span></u><span >&nbsp;&ldquo;And the Lord said unto Satan,&nbsp;</span><strong><span >Hast thou considered my servant Job</span></strong><span >, that&nbsp;</span><strong><span >there is none like him in the earth</span></strong><span >, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;"><span>I hope this study blesses you and opens your eyes to see that we truly are not alone!</span></p>
