  <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Who is Israel?</strong></h2></p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>There is a large belief that the children of God are still the Jewish nation. The topic of who the name Israel belongs to is an important issue because all the end time prophecies that relate to Israel, do not relate to the physical nation of Israel, but the spiritual nation of Israel. What is the spiritual nation of Israel? Before we dive into this subject let&rsquo;s first discover where the name Israel came from in the first place.</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><br></p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>The name Israel means &ldquo;Triumphant with God&rdquo; or &ldquo;God prevails&rdquo;. It was given to Jacob after perfectly confessing his sin. By this act of complete humility, Jacob showed how one could prevail with God. It is written &ldquo;&hellip;<strong>A contrite heart</strong>, O God, thou wilt not despise&rdquo; Psalm 51:17. God cannot turn away the sinner once the sinner truly repents from the heart. He sees the helpless soul and wishes to save him from the fate of Satan. For this act Jacob received the name Israel &ldquo;&hellip;Thy name shall be called <strong>no more Jacob</strong>, but <strong>Israel:</strong> for as a prince hast <strong>thou power with God</strong> and with men, and hast prevailed&rdquo; Genesis 32:28.</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><br></p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>God did not intend that the people that bear the name of Israel, would always be of the bloodline of Abraham. The Messiah was prophesied to come and take away the &ldquo;sceptre from Judah.&rdquo; Genesis 49:10 &ldquo;The sceptre <strong>shall not depart from Judah</strong>, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, <strong>until Shiloh [Jesus] come</strong>; and unto him shall <strong>the gathering of the people be</strong>&rdquo;. Furthermore, in Hosea 2:23 we read &ldquo;And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy [the gentiles]; and <strong>I will say to them which were not my people</strong>, <strong>Thou art my people</strong>; and they shall say, <strong>Thou art my God</strong>.&rdquo; Jesus then confirms this prophecy in Matthew 21:43 &ldquo;Therefore say I [Jesus] unto you [the Jews], <strong>The kingdom of God shall be taken from you</strong>, and <strong>given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof</strong>.&rdquo; What fruits did Jesus long to see from the Jewish nation? Galatians 5:22-23 &ldquo;But <strong>the fruit</strong> of <strong>the Spirit</strong> is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, Meekness, temperance: <strong>against such there is no law</strong>.&rdquo; The hardened hearts of the Jewish nation shut their eyes to messiah and as prophesied their status as Israel was to be taken from them.&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><br></p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>The prophet Daniel prophesied exactly when the Jewish nation would lose the title Israel, he says &ldquo;<strong>Seventy weeks</strong> <strong>are determined upon thy people</strong> and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and <strong>to make an end of sins</strong>, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and <strong>to bring in everlasting righteousness</strong>, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.&rdquo; Daniel 9:24. In the verse it&rsquo;s clear the Jewish people had seventy weeks to finish transgression, and to make an end to sin. However, what do the seventy weeks mean? And when was it supposed to begin? In the bible each day represents a year in prophecy in numbers 14:33-34 we read &ldquo;And your children shall wander in the wilderness <strong>forty years</strong>, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness. 34 After <strong>the number of the days</strong> in which ye searched the land, <strong>even forty days</strong>, <strong>each day for a year</strong>, shall ye bear your iniquities, <strong>even forty years</strong>, and ye shall know my breach of promise.&rdquo; The children of Israel were told they will be in the wilderness forty days, but each day counts for a year, therefore, forty years. Seventy weeks are four hundred and ninety years in prophecy. Daniel 9:25 &ldquo;Know therefore and understand, that <strong>from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem</strong> unto the Messiah the Prince shall be <strong>seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks</strong> [69 weeks] &hellip;&rdquo; The commandment to rebuild Jerusalem came in 457 B.C (Ezra 7). Therefore, the Jewish nation had till 434 A.D to remain as the people of God purely because of their bloodline. Did they make an end to sin? Not at all. In fact, they martyred Stephen in the same year. Acts 7:59 &ldquo;And <strong>they stoned Stephen</strong>, calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><br></p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>In the ministry of Paul, he confirmed that the prophecy spoken by Daniel had been fulfilled, Acts 13:46 &ldquo;Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you [the Jews]: but seeing ye put it from you, and <strong>judge yourselves unworthy</strong> of <strong>everlasting life</strong>, lo, <strong>we turn to the Gentiles</strong>.&rdquo; How can God&rsquo;s people be unworthy of everlasting life? The fact is the time of probation had closed for the Jewish nation, they did not repent and so lost the name of Israel. Paul expounds on this in multiple verses:</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><br></p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>Romans 2:28 <strong>For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly</strong>; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: 29 But <strong>he is a Jew, which is one inwardly</strong> [of the mind]; and circumcision is that of the heart, <strong>in the spirit</strong> [mind], and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><br></p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>Romans 9:6 Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. <strong>For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel</strong>: 7 <strong>Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham</strong>, <strong>are they all children</strong>: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called. 8 That is, <strong>They which are the children of the flesh</strong> [the Jews], <strong>these are not the children of God</strong>: but <strong>the children of the promise</strong> are counted for the seed.&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: center;"><strong>What is &ldquo;the promise&rdquo;?</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0cm; font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>Galatians 3:14 That <strong>the blessing of Abraham</strong> might come on <strong>the Gentiles through Jesus Christ</strong>; that we might receive <strong>the promise of the Spirit through faith</strong>. This verse is hammered home by Galatians 3:29 And <strong>if ye be Christ&apos;s</strong>, <strong>then are ye Abraham&apos;s seed</strong>, and <strong>heirs according to the promise</strong>. The verses are plain. If you are in Christ, then you are Israel.</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><br></p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>The Lord has been warning the children of the flesh to repent. They ignored his warnings. Jeremiah 31:35 &ldquo;Thus saith the Lord, which giveth the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The Lord of hosts is his name: 36 If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the Lord, <strong>then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever</strong>. 37 Thus saith the Lord; If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, <strong>I will also cast off all the seed of Israel</strong> for all that they have done, saith the Lord.&rdquo; The Lord was making it clear to the children of the flesh, that if it&rsquo;s possible for stars to end or the moon, then by comparison it is but a light thing to change who the chosen people of God are.</p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'><br></p>
<p style='margin:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>From this study we have demonstrated from scripture, that the people that bare the name of Israel, are indeed Christians, the idea of it being the Jewish nation also causes many to misunderstand revelation 7:4 &ldquo;And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed <strong>an hundred and forty and four thousand</strong> of all the tribes of <strong>the children of Israel</strong>. 5 Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand. 6 Of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Nephthalim were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Manasses were sealed twelve thousand.7 Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand. 8 Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand.&rdquo; Using true bible jurisprudence, we can see that the names for the tribes are prophetic symbols for the different types of Christians who will be in the 144,000 just before Jesus Christ returns. I pray this study has been a blessing to your heart.&nbsp;</p>
