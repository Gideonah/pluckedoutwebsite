     <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The state of the dead</strong></h2>
<p>We are told that in the last days that some will depart from the faith, giving heed to doctrines of devils. 1 Timothy 4:1 &ldquo;Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the <strong>latter times</strong> some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils. One these doctrines is the immortality of the soul.&rdquo; Many professed Christians believe that once a person dies, straightaway that person goes to heaven or hell, however does the bible actually teach this, are there scriptures which contradict this line of thought?</p>
<p>Before we delve deeper into this subject, we must ask ourselves, is there a way to reach sound biblical doctrine? Yes, there is. Isaiah 28:10 &ldquo;For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little and there a little.&rdquo; This scripture tells us that our doctrines can&rsquo;t contradict, once we have a precept (hypothesis), each new line we read on the topic must be in harmony with the last. If we find contradictions, then our doctrine is wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Can the dead remember?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Psalm 6:3-5<sup>&nbsp;</sup>My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O&nbsp;Lord, how long? <sup>&nbsp;</sup>Return, O&nbsp;Lord, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies' sake. <sup>&nbsp;</sup>For <strong>in death there is no remembrance of thee</strong>: <strong>in the grave who shall give thee thanks</strong>?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>If Christians go to heaven straightaway, then they can praise God right? Well let&rsquo;s ask ourselves can the dead praise God?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Psalm 115:17 <strong>The dead praise not the&nbsp;Lord</strong>, <strong>neither any</strong> that go down into silence.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Can the dead think?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Psalm 146:4 His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day <strong>his thoughts perish.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Do the dead know anything? Or can they feel emotions?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Ecclesiastes 9:5-6 For the living know that they shall die: but <strong>the dead know not anything</strong>, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten. Also, <strong>their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished</strong>; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Once again, we ask; can the dead praise God?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Isaiah 38:18 For <strong>the grave cannot praise thee</strong>, <strong>death can not celebrate thee</strong>: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.</p>
<p>From these five verses alone we can conclude that; The dead can&rsquo;t remember, they can&rsquo;t give thanks, they can&rsquo;t praise God, they can&rsquo;t think nor dream, neither can the dead interact with the living as the scripture states &ldquo;neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun&rdquo;.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>What does the bible call death?</strong></p>
<p>Psalm 13:3 &ldquo;Consider and hear me, O&nbsp;Lord&nbsp;my God: lighten mine eyes, <strong>lest I sleep the sleep of death.&rdquo;</strong> The bible calls death sleep. Are there more examples of the bible calling death a sleep?</p>
<p>1 Kings 2:10 So <strong>David&nbsp;slept&nbsp;with&nbsp;his fathers</strong>, and <strong>was buried</strong> in the city of David.</p>
<p>1 Kings 11:43 And <strong>Solomon&nbsp;slept&nbsp;with&nbsp;his fathers</strong>, and <strong>was buried</strong> in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p>1 Kings 22:40 So <strong>Ahab&nbsp;slept&nbsp;with&nbsp;his fathers</strong>; and <strong>Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead</strong>.</p>
<p>Why does the bible call death sleep? It&rsquo;s because one day everyone will wake up, some will &nbsp;wake up to life, and some will wake up to face punishment for the sins in their life. John 5:28-29 <sup>&nbsp;&ldquo;</sup>Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which <strong>all that are in the graves shall hear his voice</strong>, And shall come forth; <strong>they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only when the dead hear the voice of Jesus can they resurrect. Not understanding this simple spiritual truth can cause you to not discern the spiritual lessons Jesus tries to teach. When speaking to his disciples Jesus told them John 11:11-12 &ldquo;&hellip;Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of <strong>sleep</strong>. Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well&rdquo;. If Christ&rsquo;s disciples understood the spiritual application of the word &ldquo;sleep&rdquo;, they would understand what Jesus was saying to them was; &ldquo;our friend Lazarus is dead, but I go, that I may resurrect him&rdquo;. His disciples thinking carnally and thought Jesus was talking about literal sleep. Why go and wake up a man who&rsquo;s asleep? Jesus had to speak to them as carnal men John 11:13-14 &ldquo;Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: <strong>but they thought</strong> that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep. Then said Jesus unto them plainly, <strong>Lazarus is dead</strong>.&rdquo; Martha understood the truth about the state of the dead. John 11:23-24 &ldquo;Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again. Martha saith unto him, <strong>I know</strong> that he shall rise again in the resurrection <strong>at the last day</strong>.&rdquo; Job himself understood this truth, Job 14:12 &ldquo;So man lieth down, <strong>and riseth not: till the heavens be no more,</strong> they shall not awake, <strong>nor be raised out of their sleep</strong>.&rdquo; The verse here says &ldquo;till&rdquo;, this means that all those who go to the graves shall remain there till Christ comes. They will be either in the first resurrection or in the second resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>When shall Job see God?</strong></p>
<p>Job 19:25-26 &ldquo;For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand <strong>at the latter day upon the earth</strong>: And though after <strong>my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God</strong>.&rdquo; This passage is in harmony with job 14:12, at the latter day is when Job shall see God.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Why does he say in my flesh he shall see God, even though the worms destroy his mortal body?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Philippians 3:20-21&nbsp;For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also <strong>we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:</strong> Who shall <strong>change our vile body</strong>, that it may be fashioned like unto <strong>his glorious body</strong>, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself. When Jesus comes, he will give us a new body, which will be fashioned like his glorious body.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Who is to be the first to wake up from the dead?</strong></p>
<p>Christ is to be the first fruits of them that slept! 1 Corinthians 15:20-23 <sup>&nbsp;&ldquo;</sup>But <strong>now is Christ risen from the dead</strong>, and <strong>become the firstfruits of them that slept</strong>. For since by man came death, by man came also <strong>the resurrection of the dead</strong>. For <strong>as in Adam all die</strong>, even so <strong>in Christ shall all be made alive</strong>. <sup>&nbsp;</sup>But <strong>every man in his own order</strong>: <strong>Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>If Christ is the firstfruits of them that slept, how can one say patriarchs like Abraham are in heaven? The next fruits unto Christ are &ldquo;they that are Christ&rsquo;s at his coming&rdquo;. Meaning they must wait in the graves till he comes. As Martha previously told us. &ldquo;I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day&rdquo; John 11:24 Now there are some which have gone to heaven, but these people we know by name.</p>
<p>Genesis 5:24 And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; <strong>for God took him</strong>.</p>
<p>2 Kings 2:11 And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and <strong>Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven</strong>.</p>
<p>Jude 1:9 Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil <strong>he disputed about the body of Moses</strong>, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.</p>
<p>Elijah and Enoch never saw death, Moses was Resurrected by Jesus, that&rsquo;s why Moses appeared at the mount of transfiguration. Matthew 17:4 "Then answered Peter, and <strong>said unto Jesus</strong>, Lord, it is good&nbsp;for&nbsp;us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles;&nbsp;one&nbsp;for&nbsp;thee, and&nbsp;<strong>one&nbsp;for&nbsp;Moses</strong>, and&nbsp;one&nbsp;for&nbsp;Elias." Although Moses did die before Jesus came (Joshua 1:1), he was resurrected before Jesus&rsquo;s death for a specific purpose, in the mount of transfiguration Moses symbolises those who will arise at the second coming of Christ, whilst Elijah symbolises those who will be taken to heaven alive. This group of Christians are represented by Elijah are known as the 144,000 (revelation 7:5-8), they will never taste death.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>How did this confusion of the state of the dead begin?</strong></p>
<p>When speaking to the thief on the cross&hellip; Luke 23:43 <sup>&ldquo;</sup>And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, <strong>To day shalt thou be with me in paradise</strong>.&rdquo; After reading this verse one would assume, when Jesus died, he went to heaven that day and the thief on the cross was with him right? First of all, Jesus didn&rsquo;t ascend to Heaven that day. After Jesus resurrected he told Mary; John 20:17 &ldquo;Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for <strong>I am not yet ascended to my Father</strong>: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Jesus hadn&rsquo;t yet been to heaven after he died on the cross, why did he tell the theif &ldquo;Today shalt thou be with me in paradise&rdquo;? In fact, we know Jesus didn&rsquo;t lie, &ldquo;God is not a man, that he should lie&hellip;&rdquo; Numbers 23:19 Jesus, who knows all things, should&rsquo;ve known when the thief would die, isn&rsquo;t he God? He even knows what will happen ahead of time. John 14:29 &ldquo;behold I have told <strong>you before It come to pass</strong>, that, when it come to pass ye might believe&rdquo;. Wouldn&rsquo;t this include knowing when the thief would die? John 19:31-33 <sup>&ldquo;</sup>The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, <strong>that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day</strong>, (for that sabbath day was an <strong>high day</strong>,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. Then came the soldiers, and <strong>brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him</strong>. But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seems the thief on the cross didn&rsquo;t actually die on the day Jesus died. So, what&rsquo;s going on in Luke 23:43? The answer is punctuation! Punctuation is added by the translator in order to improve one&rsquo;s understanding of a text. However, in Luke 23:43 the comma should be placed after the word &ldquo;today&rdquo; thus reading.</p>
<p>Luke 23:43 <sup>&nbsp;&ldquo;</sup>And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee To day, shalt thou be with me in paradise.&rdquo; The word The phrase &ldquo;to day&rdquo; can also be defined as &ldquo;this day&rdquo; which translates from the word <em>sēmeron</em> in Strong&rsquo;s G3588, it&rsquo;s used in this verse for example <strong>Matthew 27:8 </strong>Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto <strong>this day</strong>.&nbsp;<strong><sup>G4594 </sup></strong>This is to prove the point that Jesus was saying &ldquo;Verily I say unto thee this day, shalt thou be with me in paradise&rdquo;. He was referring to the time of his promise, not the time in which the thief on the cross was to receive the promise.</p>
<p>Now to hammer this point home let&rsquo;s take King David, many who believe to be a heaven bound man. Even the Jews believed this. Ask a Christian do you believe king David is in heaven? They will most likely reply yes. Then show them this passage. Acts 2:29-34 &ldquo;Men and brethren, <strong>let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David</strong>, that <strong>he is both dead and buried</strong>, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day. Therefore <strong>being a prophet</strong>, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, <strong>he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne</strong>; <strong>He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ</strong>, that <strong>his soul (body) was not left in hell (grave)</strong>, neither his flesh did see corruption. <strong>This Jesus hath God raised up</strong>, whereof we all are witnesses. Therefore, being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear. <strong>For David is not ascended into the heavens</strong>: but he saith himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the scripture plainly tells us &ldquo;<strong>For David is not ascended into the heavens</strong>&rdquo;. The reason the Jews thought he was in heaven was because of the passage Psalm 16:10 &ldquo;For thou wilt not leave <strong>my</strong> soul (body) in hell (grave); neither <strong>wilt thou</strong> suffer thine Holy One (Jesus) to see corruption.&rdquo; The Jews thought David was referring to himself, however he was speaking of Jesus&rsquo;s Death, Jesus was not left in the grave. &ldquo;He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.&rdquo; In fact who does scripture say is the &ldquo;Holy One&rdquo;? Mark 1:24 "&hellip;Let&nbsp;<em>us</em>&nbsp;alone; what have we to do with thee,&nbsp;<strong>thou</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Jesus of Nazareth</strong>?&nbsp;art&nbsp;thou&nbsp;come to destroy us?&nbsp;I&nbsp;know&nbsp;thee&nbsp;who&nbsp;thou&nbsp;art, <strong>the Holy One of God</strong>." There is only one Holy One. I pray that the Holy Spirit convicts your heart to accept this truth as it is written Hebrews 3:15 &ldquo;...To day&nbsp;if&nbsp;ye will&nbsp;hear&nbsp;his voice, harden not&nbsp;your&nbsp;hearts&hellip;&rdquo; This doctrine is what opens the door for many people to accept the more lies from Satan! I pray your eyes have been opened by this study. Maranatha!</p>
