      <h1 style="text-align: center;">Prayer</h1>
      
      <h6 style="text-align: center;">Why do we need to pray?</h6>
      <p>The primary reason for this study is because we are in the last days. Due to the upcoming trials we need to stay in our bibles daily and constantly go to the Lord in prayer, as it is written in I Thessalonians 5:17 “pray without ceasing”. The secondary reason for this study is to help those whose prayer lives have been crippled with the misrepresentation of the gift of tongues (the ability to speaking in other languages). For many souls after leaving this false teaching, they find it hard to pray to their Heavenly Father, so I pray that this study
blesses you and allows you communicate with your maker as he desires.
According to the Cambridge dictionary, The word prayer means; “to speak to God either privately or in a religious ceremony to express love, admiration, thanks,
or in order to ask for something”. - Cambridge dictionary </p>

      <h6 style="text-align: center;">What's the proper prayer "etiquette"?</h6>
      <p>When you meet an earthly king or queen, there are a few do’s and don’ts. To not abide by these rules would be considered rude, even by earthly standards. Take the monarch of England (who is Queen Elizabeth II at the time of writing). There are a few do’s and don’ts when you meet her.<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-40668579"> Etiquette for meeting the Queen:</a>  <ul> <li>Courtesy or Bow</li>
<li>Use the right greetings</li>
<li>Be early</li>
<li>Take the Queen’s lead</li>
<li>Form semi-circles (lead in a series of semi- circles when coming to meet the queen)</li></ul></p>

<p>One may ask, why am I talking about the Queen of England? Are we not talking about God? Well, what does God call Himself? Malachi 1:14 "...for I am a <b><u>great king</u></b>, saith the Lord of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the heathen". In fact The God that we serve is not only a Great King, but He is the King of Kings. Revelation 17:14 "These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them, <b><u>for he is King of Kings and Lord of Lords</u></b>, and they that are with him, are called, and
chosen, and faithful". If there are do’s and don’ts for talking to the Queen, how much more for the one who created that Queen?</p> 


      <h6 style="text-align: center;">Are you greater than a King?</h6>
      

      <p>When King Solomon prayed to God, he knelt down and prayed to the Lord.
2 Chronicles 6:12-13 "And he stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all the congregation of
Israel, and spread forth his hands: For Solomon had made a brasen
scaffold of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and
had set it in the midst of the court: and upon it he stood, <b><u>and kneeled
down upon his knees</b></u> before all the congregation of Israel, and <b><u>spread
forth his hands toward heaven</b></u>."

      <p>Notice King Solomon "spread forth his hands toward heaven". When we pray we also lift up Holy hands towards heaven. 1 Timothy 2:8 
"I will therefore that men pray every where, <b><u>lifting up holy hands</b></u>, without wrath and doubting". Nowadays a lot of Christians, through ignorance, use the pagan hand symbol to pray. Notice the priest praying to the sun god depicted in the Tablet of Shamash. The priest prays with clasped hands. This is one the earliest depictions of this type of prayer. Thanks to the of the first beast of Revelation (<a href="https://www.remnantofgod.org/666-CHAR.htm">the papacy</a>), many christians have accepted this posture of prayer.</p>



<p>The first thing to do in prayer to God is to humble ourselves and get on our knees. Do we have more examples of this in the Bible?
Daniel 6:10 Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his
house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, <b><u>he kneeled upon
his knees three times a day</b></u>, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime". Daniel, the prophet of God, kneeled three times a day in prayer, another good example to follow. Stephen when he was about to die, kneeled and petitioned to God asking not to lay the sins of the pharisees and the chief priests to their charge. Acts 7:60 "<b><u>And he kneeled down</b></u>, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep".

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Pope Benedict XVI showing the clasped hands form of prayer.</i></p>

<p>
Peter and Paul both kneeled when they prayed. Acts 9:40 "But Peter put them all forth, and <b><u>kneeled down</b></u>, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up". Acts 20:36-37 "And when he (Paul) had thus spoken, <b><u>he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.</b></u> And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him". Acts 21:5 "And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till we were out of the city: and <b><u>we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed</b></u>".</p>

<p> We have seen an apostle, a disciple, a prophet and a king all kneeling to the King of kings. When Jesus was in the mount of Olives and withdrew from his disciples, notice what he did before he prayed: Luke 22:40-42 "And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation. And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, <b><u>and kneeled down, and prayed</b></u>, Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done". Are we greater than our Lord and Saviour, the one we call King of kings? If it is proper to courtesy or bow before the Queen, how much more your Heavenly Father, the “Majesty” of heaven (Hebrews 1:3). Malachi 1:14 "...for I am a <b><u>great king</u></b>, saith the Lord of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the heathen". In fact The God that we serve is not only a Great King, but He is the King of Kings. In fact didn’t Jesus tell us not to stand in prayer? He knows the reason why men stand in prayer.
Matthew 6:5 "And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for <b><u>they love to pray standing</u></b> in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men". </p>

           
<p>If more ministers followed Jesus’s example of prayer, and humbled themselves, a lot more humility would be shown on the pulpits, and when the truth reaches them they would find it easier to repent and turn to the Lord, but like the pharisees of old, even disobeying this simple command has blinded them, and with puffed up egos, their hearts are hardened. Like the pharisees of old, they do things for the praises of men. In fact here’s an example of someone directly standing and praying in the bible, listen to the parable by Jesus. Luke 18:10-13 "Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. The Pharisee <b><u>stood and prayed</u></b> thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess. And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner". The pharisee “stands and prays”, where as the publican “would not lift so much as his eyes unto heaven!”, and please do not get confused with the phrase “standing afar off”, in this context it simply means he was “staying away” or “distanced” from the pharisee. To illustrate this we see the same language in Revelation 18:10 “Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come”. Revelation 18 is speaking prophetically of the nations that are “staying away” from the Vatican when they fall during the plagues, cities don’t stand. However, the point Christ Is making is clear those that stand and pray do it because they want to be seen of men. They have pride in their hearts. As they do not bow to their creator, they have the same spirit of rebellion that was in Satan.</p>

<h6 style="text-align: center;">Our prayers should be to the point!</h6>
<p>Matthew 6:7-8 "But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.
Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him". Wow! isn't that great a God, a God that can read your mind doesn't need you repeat the same thing over and over like a ritualistic chant. He already knows what you want before you asked him! isn't it written "Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee..." Jeremiah 1:5. This isn't to say we can't ever pray the same prayer twice as Jesus prayed the same prayer three times, just before the cross. Matthew 26:44 "And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words". The lesson to learn here is that praying the same words repeatedly in the same prayer, without any heartfelt meaning to the words, just becomes a ritualistic chant. To illustrate this point, when a child asks for a toy from their parents, the parents probably already have an idea of what their child will ask for. If the child says "can i have a toy, can i have a toy, can i have toy, can i have a toy". such a repetition can seem annoying to the parent. However, if the child asks one day "can i have a toy", then comes back another day and asks for that toy again, after a while the parents grant the child's petition. Luke 18:1-8 "And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint; Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man: And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man; Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me. And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith. And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?"</p>

<h6 style="text-align: center;">Praise, Repent, Ask, Yield</h6>
<p>Matthew 6:9-14 "After this <b><u>manner</b></u> therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen. For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses". These verses are merely an outline for prayer, before you pray make sure you have no anger towards your brethren, if they’ve done something wrong against you, forgive them. Then as you pray praise the Lord for what he has done for you that day, hour, minute, literally anything, as he has done much for you. If you have any sins confess, confess them before the Lord so that you don’t retain unconfessed sin. The Holy Spirit will bring to remembrance what you have done wrong. After this now ask the Lord your petition. Be wise, if you pray for 1 billion dollars although it’s possible to receive that from the Lord, he knows your heart and why you’re asking, don’t deceive yourself and say it’s to help the ministry, if you truly know you just lust for money, then you ask amiss.
James 4:3 Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts. When you pray do it with an unwavering heart, have faith that the Lord will answer your prayer. James 1:6 "But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord. A double minded man is unstable in all his ways". </p>

           
<p> Finally, in your prayer yield to the Father’s will, the same way a son will ask of things from his father, a father may want his son to pass certain classes in school before he rewards him. This doesn’t mean the father doesn’t want to reward him, however he knows the reward will be much more appreciated after yielding to his will.
I’d like to note that we are to “pray without ceasing” 1 Thessalonians 5:17, does this mean we are to spend five hours on our knees everyday praying? Matthew 6:7 “But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.” If God already knows what we want, how do we reconcile the two verses? Didn’t the prophet Daniel “pray without ceasing”? Daniel 6:10 “...he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime”. James 5:16 "Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much". It’s important to pray daily, a good example is Daniel, three times a day, because it is written “Men ought always to pray” Luke 18:1. Due to these trying times, we need to stick by our Heavenly Father, because only He can pull us through, we need to depend on him for our strength, so that our walk will be perfect our Lord when he returns. Maranatha!</p>
