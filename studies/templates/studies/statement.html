<h1><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Statement of Faith</strong></p></h1>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>REGARDING TRUTH</strong></p>
<p><br /> #1. This summary of beliefs is for the purpose of confessing Christ and His truth (see Matt. 10:32,33; 28:20; Rev. 19:10; 22:9). The summary has no authority of it's own, and should never be used to settle doctrinal controversy. The Word of God is the authority for resolving any doctrinal differences (see Matt. 22:29; 2 Tim. 3:16). Doctrinal differences are not decided democratically (majority rules) but only by the weight of evidence found in scripture. Since it is "impossible for God to lie", all of His Word is truth (Heb. 6:18; see Titus 1:2; Psalm 119:142; John 17:17); this means that true doctrines will be in harmony with "every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God" and "all that the prophets have spoken" (Matt. 4:4; Luke 24:25). Nevertheless, it is dangerous to base any doctrine on only one text (see Isa. 28:9-13). Actually, since God "cannot lie", one text would be sufficient if and only if it was interpreted correctly; but fallen humans are susceptible to misinterpretation, so before accepting any doctrine there should be at least "two or three witnesses" from inspiration in support of it (Deut. 17:6; 19:15; see 1 John 5:6,8; John 15:26; 14:26; 16:13; 2 Peter 1:20, 21). On the other hand, no doctrine should be taught or believed as long as there are two or three texts for which no answers (which will stand up to close examination) can be given&mdash;regardless of how many texts seem to support it (see 1 Peter 3:15; Matt. 22:12,34; Rom. 3:19; Titus 1:11).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>GOD</strong></p>
<p><br /> #2. The eternal Godhead consists of Three Living Persons- the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit or Ghost. These three beings are eternal. It is in the name of God- the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit- that those who receive Christ by living faith are baptized, and these three separate powers will cooperate in changing the character of the obedient subjects to reflect their own. (Gen. 1:26; Isa. 48:16; Matt. 1:23; 3:16, 17; 28:19; John 8:58; 18:5, 6; 14:26; 15:26; Acts 5:3, 4; 10:38; 17:22-29; 2 Cor. 13:14; Eph. 4:4-6; Heb. 9:14; 1 Peter 1:2).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE FATHER</strong></p>
<p><br /> #3. Our heavenly Father, the first Person of the Godhead, is a personal, spiritual Being, omnipotent, omniscient, and eternal; infinite in wisdom, holiness, justice, goodness, truth, and mercy; and is unchangeable. The qualities and powers exhibited in the Son and the Holy Spirit are also revelations of the Father. (Gen. 1:1; Mal. 3:6; John 3:16; 14:9; 1 Cor. 8:5,6; 15:28; Eph. 3:9; 4:6; 1 Tim. 1:17; 1 John 4:8; Jer. 10:10-12; Heb. 1:1-3)</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE SON</strong></p>
<p><br /> #4. Jesus Christ, the second person of the Godhead, the eternal Son of God, Who created all things in co-operation with His Father, and the Holy Spirit, is fully divine. He took upon Himself man's fallen nature from the seed of Abraham; He was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary therefore fully human, yet never sinned at any time, and is the only Saviour from sin. He lived and experienced temptation as any other human being, but perfectly exemplified the righteousness and love of God. He suffered and died voluntarily on the cross for our sins and in our place (ending the handwriting of ordinances and feasts which were shadows of this grand event), was raised from the dead, and ascended to minister in the heavenly sanctuary in our behalf. All judgment has been given unto Him. Man's salvation is by grace through faith in Him and He will return a second time in glory for the final deliverance of His people. Jesus is known by many names in Scripture, not one of which is to be used exclusively when addressing the Saviour who reads the intentions of the heart. (Ex. 3:14; 1 Chr. 28:9; Ps. 44:21; Matt. 28:18,19; John 1:1-3, 14; 3:16; 5:22; 8:58; 10:30; 14:1-3; Micah 5:2; Matt. 1:21-23; 2:5, 6; 12:34-37; Luke 1:35; Acts 4:10-12; Col. 1:15-19; 2:14; 1 John 5:11,12; Eph. 1:9-15; 2:4-8; Rom. 3:23-26; 5:17; 6:23; 8:27; 1 Cor. 15:3, 4; 2 Cor. 5:17-21; Phil. 2:5-11; Heb. 1; 2; 4:14,15; 7:25; 8:1-3; 9:28; 11:3; 1 Peter 2:21; Rev. 21; 22:20)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE HOLY SPIRIT</strong></p>
<p><br /> #5. The Holy Spirit, the third person of the Godhead, is Christ's representative on earth, and leads sinners to repentance and to obedience of all God's requirements. He is the Comforter who guides us into all truth and convicts us of sin. He was active with the Father and the Son in creation, incarnation, and redemption. He inspired the writers of Scripture and safeguards it. He filled Christ&rsquo;s life with power and those who respond to Jesus, He will renew and transform into His image. He gives spiritual gifts to the body of Christ (the church), empowering them to bear witness for Jesus. (Gen 1:1, 2; Matt. 28:18,19; Luke 1:35; 4:18; John 3:5; 14:16-18, 26; 15:26, 27; 16:7-15; Acts 1:8; 10:38; Rom. 1:1-4; 1 Cor. 2:10; 2 Cor. 3:18; Eph. 4:30; Heb. 9:14; 2 Peter 1:21)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>CREATION</strong></p>
<p><br /> #6. God is the creator of all good things, and has revealed in Scripture the authentic account of His creative activity. In six literal days the Lord made &ldquo;the heaven and the earth&rdquo; and all the living things therein, and rested on the seventh day of that first week. Thus originated the seven day weekly cycle. The first man and woman were made in the image of God as the crowning work of creation, given dominion over the world, and charged with responsibility to care for it. When the world was finished it was &ldquo;very good&rdquo; declaring the glory of God. (Gen. 1; 2:1-3; Ex. 20:8-11, 31; Ps. 19:1, 2; 33:6, 9; 104; John 1:1-3, 14; Col. 1:14-17; Heb. 11:3; 2 Pet. 3:4, 5).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>GOD&rsquo;S WORD</strong></p>
<p><br /> #7. The Bible (translated from the received [aka majority] texts such as the King James Version) is God's inspired Word, though written by man, is the authoritative, infallible revelation of God's will, and is the full, sufficient, and only rule of faith and practice. The Holy Scriptures are the standard of character, the test of experience, the authoritative revealer of doctrines, and the trustworthy record of God&rsquo;s acts in history. In His word, God has committed to man the knowledge necessary for salvation. God protects His word and promises that it will not come back to Him void. (2 Tim. 3:15-17; 2 Peter 1:19-21; Ps. 119:9,11,105,130; Prov. 30:5, 6; John 10:35; 17:17; 1 Thess. 2:13; Isa. 8:20; 55:11; Jer. 15:16; Heb. 4:12)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>ETERNAL LIFE</strong></p>
<p><br /> #8. Immortality comes only through obedience to God's word and is bestowed as a gift from God at Christ's second coming. This is not to say that it is of works that we are saved. Obedience is the fruit of faith, salvation is the gift of faith. (1 Cor. 15:21,22,51-55; Ps. 146:3,4; Eccl. 9:5,6,10; 1 Tim. 6:15,16; 2 Tim. 1:10; 1 John 5:11,12)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>DEATH</strong></p>
<p><br /> #9. Mankind is mortal (subject to death). When people die they are unconscious (asleep). All people, good and evil alike, remain in the grave from death until the resurrections. (Eccl. 9:5,6; Ps. 115:17; 146:3,4; Job 14:10-12,21,22; 17:13; John 11:11-14; 1 Thess. 4:13; John 5:28,29 1 Cor 15:20-23)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>CONVERSION</strong></p>
<p><br /> #10. All who enter the kingdom of heaven will be born again, converted individuals. Through Christ, believers receive forgiveness of sins which are confessed and forsaken, and for which, as far as lies in their power, restitution is made. Christ dwells in the converted heart, writing upon it the principles of God's law, leading the believer to delight to obey its precepts, and imparting power for such obedience. (Matt. 5:23,24; 6:14,15; 18:3; John 3:3; 2 Cor. 5:17; 6:16; Eze. 33:15; 36:26,27; 1 Peter 1:23; 2:2; Ps. 40:8; Heb. 8:10-12; John 14:15; Col. 1:14, 15, 27; 3:16; Gal. 2:20; Eph. 1:7; 3:14-21; 1 John 1:7-9; Isa. 55:6,7).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>CHRISTIAN GROWTH</strong></p>
<p><br /> #11. Through the study of the Word, God speaks to us, imparting light and strength; through prayer the soul is united with God. These are Heaven's ordained means for obtaining victory in the conflict with sin and for the development of Christian character. (Ps. 19:7,8; 119:130; John 6:63; 17:17; 1 Peter 2:2; 1 Thess. 5:17; Luke 18:1; Ps. 55:17; Isa. 50:4)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE HOLY SABBATH DAY</strong></p>
<p><br /> #12. The seventh day of the week, known today as Saturday, is the eternal sign of Christ's power as Creator, Sanctifier, and Redeemer and is, therefore, the Lord's day; the true Christian Sabbath, constituting the seal of the living God. It is observed from sunset Friday to sunset Saturday. (Gen. 2:1-3; Ex. 16:24-31; 20:8-11; John 1:1-3,14; Eze. 20:12,20; Mark 1:21-32; 2:27,28; Isa. 58:13; Luke 4:16; 23:54-56; 24:1; Acts 17:2; Heb. 4:9-11; Isa. 66:22,23; Lev. 23:32; Rev. 7:1-8)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>OUR BODY TEMPLE</strong></p>
<p><br /> #13. The Christian will recognize his body as the temple of the Holy Spirit. Therefore he will honor God by caring for his body, abstaining from such things as caffeinated and alcoholic beverages, illicit and social drugs, tobacco in all its forms, the blood and fat of flesh foods, and all unclean meats. Christians will be striving to comply with God's instruction concerning the original diet of Gen 1:29 and 3:18. (1 Cor. 3:16,17; 6:19,20; 9:25; 10:1-11,31; 2 Cor. 7:1; Gal. 5:17-21; 6:7,8; 1 Peter 2:9-12; Lev. 11:1-8; Acts 11:8; Acts 15:29)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>CHRISTIAN BEHAVIOR</strong></p>
<p><br /> #14. In the Christian life, there is complete separation from worldly practices such as ungodly card playing, visiting theaters, dancing, novel reading, competitive sports, watching unprofitable television programs, and listening to sensual, worldly music etc., which tend to deaden and destroy the spiritual life. (2 Cor. 6:14-18; 1 John 2:15-17; James 4:4; 2 Tim. 2:19-22; Eph. 5:8-11; Col. 3:5-10)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>CHRISTIAN DRESS AND ADORNMENT</strong></p>
<p><br /> #15. The Christian is called unto sanctification and their life should be characterized by carefulness in conduct and in modesty and simplicity in dress. There should be a plain distinction between the dress of men and women. He or she is to refrain from any attire that is out of keeping with the Biblical rule of modesty, and from the wearing of earrings, necklaces, bracelets, rings, colorful cosmetics, and any form of adornment that draws attention to themselves. Their influence is to come from the inner adornment of a character that will attract others to Jesus. (2 Kings 9:30; Jer. 4:30; 1 Thess. 3:13; 4:3,7; 5:23; 1 Peter 2:21; 3:3-5,15; Isa. 3:16-24; 1 Cor. 10:31; 1 Tim. 2:9,10; Deut. 22:5)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>MARRIAGE</strong></p>
<p><br /> #16. Marriage was ordained by God in Eden before the fall, for the benefit of humanity, and its sanctity is guarded by one of the ten commandments (see Gen 1:27; 2:18-25; Ex 20:14; Prov 18:22; Heb 13:4). The only ground for divorce in Scripture is "fornication"; after such a divorce the innocent party has the Scriptural right to remarry, but it is "adultery" for the guilty party to remarry either before or after the innocent party remarries (see Matt 5:31,32; 19:3-12; Mark 10:2-12; Luke 16:18; Rom 7:1-3; 1 Cor 7:1-40). If there has been a divorce on other than Biblical grounds, or merely a separation without a divorce, reconciliation is the ideal; but even if the two remain separated, they are still married to each other in God's eyes, and should act accordingly (see 1 Cor. 7:10,11).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>BAPTISM</strong></p>
<p><br /> #17. Baptism by immersion is a symbol of the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ and openly expresses faith in His saving grace and the giving up of sin and the world. It is recognized as a condition of becoming a member of the body of Christ. (Matt .3:13-17; 28:19; Acts 2:38,41-47; 8:35,39; 16:32,33; 22:16; Rom. 6:1-11; Gal. 3:27; Col. 3:1-3)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE CHURCH</strong></p>
<p><br /> #18. The Bible teaches the definite organization of the body of Christ (the church) which is comprised of those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. The members of Christ&rsquo;s body will be doers of the word and not hearers only. According to Gospel order, the members of this organization are all brethren and under sacred obligation to be subject unto Christ, the Head of the church, to loyally support His work, and to share in its maintenance. Thus the church, being subject unto Christ and consisting of brethren, is not a hierarchy but likened to different parts of a body functioning according to the dictates of the Holy Spirit and not man. His body is not to be congregational, separated into independent atoms, but is to be an organized, functioning machine. As God is the head of Christ, so Christ shall be the head of every man, and man is the head of woman. A woman is not to usurp authority over the man, and all ordained leaders must be men of good repute. Members are not to forsake the assembling of themselves together. God is no respector of persons and if a body of believers becomes unfaithful and disobedient, falling into apostasy, He is not under obligation to keep His promises to them. Those who are members of the body of Christ will not hold membership in a fallen church but will remove their name and themselves from all apostasy. (Ps. 40:8-10; Matt. 16:1-3, 16-18; 18:15-20; 23:37, 38; Eph. 1:10-23; 2:12, 19-22; 3:8-11, 15; 4:11-15; 1 Cor. 10:4; 11:3; 12:12-28; 14:33-40; 2 Cor. 6:14-18; Titus 1:5-9; Heb. 10:24-27; Acts 1:8; 2:38, 41, 42; 4:32-35; 6:1-7; 7:38; Rom. 2:28, 29; 8:15-17; James 1:22; 2 Tim. 2:11, 12; 3:1-13; 1 Peter 2:3-6; Rev. 14:12; 22:14)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>SPIRITUAL GIFTS</strong></p>
<p><br /> #19. The church is to come behind in no gift. These gifts are bestowed by the Holy Spirit and are given &ldquo;For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.&rdquo; Speaking in tongues is only one of the many gifts given by the Holy Spirit and it is not a test of fellowship or a sign of salvation. The presence of the gift of the &lsquo;Spirit of Prophecy (inspired and protected by the Holy Spirit)&rsquo; is to be one of the identifying marks of God's true church at the end of time. We recognize that this gift was manifested in the life and ministry of Ellen G. White. (John 20:21, 22; 1 Cor. 1:5-7; 12:1-28; Amos 3:7; Hosea 12:10,13; Rev. 12:17; 19:10; Eph. 4:12-13).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>STEWARDSHIP</strong></p>
<p><br /> #20. The tithe is holy unto the Lord and is God's provision for the support of His ministry. It consists of a tenth of all our gross increase and is considered to be the &ldquo;first fruits&rdquo; given unto the Lord. It reminds us that God is the owner of all things. Freewill offerings are also a part of God's plan for the support of His work throughout the world. (Lev. 27:30-32; Mal. 3:8-12; Num. 18:20-28; Matt. 23:23; Prov. 3:9,10; 1 Cor. 9:13,14; 2 Cor. 9:6,7; Ps. 96:8; Luke 18:12)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE LORD&rsquo;S SUPPER</strong></p>
<p><br /> #21. The ordinance of the Lord's Supper commemorates the Savior&rsquo;s death as the Lamb of God (thus replacing the Passover service); participation by members of the body is essential to Christian growth and fellowship. It is to be preceded by the ordinance of foot washing as a preparation for this solemn service. (Matt. 26:26-29; 1 Cor. 11:23-30; John 1:29; 6:48-56; 13:1-17)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>INVESTIGATIVE JUDGMENT</strong></p>
<p><br /> #22. Upon His ascension, Christ began His ministry as high priest in the holy place of the heavenly sanctuary, which sanctuary is the antitype of the earthly tabernacle of the former dispensation. As in the type, a work of investigative judgment began as Christ entered the second phase of His ministry, in the most holy place, foreshadowed in the earthly service by the Day of Atonement. This work of the investigative judgment in the heavenly sanctuary and the final atonement began on October 22, 1844, closing off the last pre-advent time prophecy of the Bible, the 2300 days of Daniel 8:14. The investigative judgment constitutes the final judgment of our life's record (close of probation) before Jesus returns. (Heb. 4:14; 8:1,2; Lev. 16:2,29; Heb. 9:23,24; Dan. 8:14; 9:24-27; Rev. 14:6,7; 22:11)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>SPIRITUAL BABYLON</strong></p>
<p><br /> #23. Prophecy declares that Spiritual Babylon will consist of a body (not an individual) that was once Biblically pure, but has become corrupted with doctrinal error [fallen into apostasy]. The papacy [Roman Catholic Church] is the antichrist of the Bible prophecy; it was the great persecuting power of the Middle [Dark] Ages and will again, in partnership with apostate Protestantism [fallen Christian churches], persecute God's saints at the end of time. It is the change of the true seventh day Sabbath to the counterfeit Sunday, and the many pagan and unbiblical teachings that she has introduced to Christendom that denotes her as modern, spiritual Babylon. Spiritual Babylon is also the mother of Harlots [apostate Protestantism: fallen Christian churches]. ANY church, denomination, organization, fellowship, group, etc&hellip; which has at least one unrepentant character trait of Spiritual Babylon such as: the immortality of the soul, the eternal torment of the wicked, the denial of the pre-existence of Christ prior to His birth in Bethlehem, the abolishing of the Law of God, &lsquo;Original Sin&rsquo; (being born a sinner), advocating and exalting the first day of the week above God&rsquo;s holy, sanctified day (the seventh day known as the Sabbath), and kindred errors which cannot be substantiated from the Scriptures; is a daughter to the great whore and is leading people to be sealed in their sins resulting in death and Hell. (1 John 4:2,3; Dan. 2:40, 41; 7:7, 8, 20-25; 11:31, 36-39, 45; Rev. 12; 13:1-8; 17; 18:23, 24)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE MARK OF THE BEAST</strong></p>
<p><br /> #24. The religious observance of the first day of the week, known today as Sunday, is the Pagan counterfeit of seventh-day Sabbath observance. Sunday has been promoted by the papacy as a mark of her authority. When Sunday observance is enforced by United States civil law it becomes the end-time mark of the beast. (Ex. 31:13; Eze. 20:12,20; Rev. 7:1-8; 13:11-17; 14:1,9,10)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>CHRIST&rsquo;S SECOND COMING</strong></p>
<p><br /> #25. The second coming of Christ is the hope of the church, the climax of the gospel, when Jesus will come literally, personally, loudly, visibly on a cloud (never touching the earth), and with all of His holy angels. Jesus pointed to signs of the times that would testify that His coming is at hand. And the almost complete fulfillment of all the various lines of prophecy indicates "He is near, even at the doors." (John 14:1-3; Titus 2:11-14; Heb. 9:28; Acts 1:9-11; Rev. 1:7; Matt. 25:31; Luke 9:25; 21:25-33; Matt. 24:14,36-39,33 margin)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE FIRST RESURRECTION</strong></p>
<p><br /> #26. The righteous dead will be raised to life at Christ's second coming (advent). Together with the righteous living, they will be caught up to meet the Lord in the air, and will go with Him to heaven, there to spend one thousand years (the millennium). The wicked that are living at the time of Christ's second advent will be slain by the brightness of His coming. These, with the wicked dead of all ages, will await the final resurrection, at the close of the one thousand years. (Rev. 1:7; John 5:25,28,29; Hosea 13:14; 1 Cor. 15:51-55; 1 Thess. 4:13-18; John 11:24,25; 14:1-3; Rev. 20:4,5,6; Isa. 25:8,9; 2 Thess. 1:7-10; 2:8; Jude 14,15; Rev. 20:5,12,15; John 5:28,29; Acts 24:15; Isa. 24:21,22).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE FINAL RESURRECTION</strong></p>
<p><br /> #27. At the end of the one thousand years, the following events will take place: (a) Christ and the righteous will descend from heaven, with the Holy City, the New Jerusalem (Rev 21:2,10); (b) the wicked dead will be resurrected (Rev 21:11,12); (c) Satan, his angels and the wicked will receive the final wages of sin when fire comes down from God out of heaven to utterly destroy them, death and hell. This is the second death (1 Cor. 15:26; Rev 20:7-10,14,15); and (d) this fire, which destroys the works of sin, will purify the earth (2 Peter 3:10-14; Mal. 4:1-3; Rev. 20:4,8).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE NEW EARTH</strong></p>
<p><br /> #28. The earth, cleansed by fire and re-created by the power of God, will become the eternal home of the redeemed and God Himself will live with them. (2 Peter 3:9-13; Isa. 65:17-25; 35:1-10; 45:18; Matt. 5:5; Mal. 4:1-3; Prov. 11:31)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>OUR MESSAGE</strong></p>
<p><br /> #29. In accordance with God's uniform dealing with mankind, warning them of coming events that will vitally affect their destiny, He has sent forth a proclamation of the approaching return of Christ. This preparatory message is symbolized by the three angels' messages of Revelation 14. And the fourth angel's message of Revelation 18. Every true believer (God&rsquo;s Remnant) will announce these messages which includes a) the announcement of the arrival of the judgment hour, b) salvation through Christ and the approach of His second coming, c) a call to worship the true God and forsake all false doctrines, romanism, and paganism, d) a description of Babylon and her daughters, and e) the warning not to receive the mark of the beast and partake of the plagues. The proclamation of these messages result in a sanctified people who keep the commandments of God, have the faith of Jesus, and who are completely separated from spiritual Babylon, her daughters, Paganism, and Romanism in any form, and are ready to meet Jesus face to face without seeing death. God&rsquo;s people must obey the voice of their Master Shepherd and separate from Babylon&rsquo;s fellowship and come into His fold or they will partake of the plagues. (Amos 3:7; Matt. 24:29-34; Rev. 12; 13; 14; 17:1-18; 18:1-5; 2 Cor. 6:14-18; Zeph. 3:13; Micah 4:7,8; Isa. 26:2; Rev. 22:14).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>PERSONAL EVANGELISM</strong></p>
<p><br /> #30. Every church member is under sacred command from Jesus to use his talents in personal soul-winning work in helping to give the present truth of the gospel to the entire world. When this work is finished and the character of Christ is perfectly reproduced in His people, Jesus will come. (Matt. 24:14; 5:48; 25:14-29; 28:18-20; Rev. 22:17; Isa. 43:10-12; 2 Cor. 5:17-20; Rom. 10:13-15; Gen. 17:1; Eph. 4:12,13)</p>

<p><strong>This brief summary should be considered as merely an introductory overview. No believer should consider that this summary includes the entire scope of Christian faith and practice; instead, believers should learn, observe, and even teach all things whatsoever Christ has commanded (see Matt 28:20). Every Christian should have a commitment to study the Word of God daily and continue to "grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ." (2 Peter 3:18; see Luke 2:52; John 6:48-63; Acts 17:11; 2 Tim. 2:15).</strong></p>
