      <h1 style="text-align: center;">Trinity or Godhead?</h1>
      
      
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The trinity is widely taught misconception in many churches today. It is taught that there is one God who manifests Himself in different forms. It&rsquo;s a lie straight from the devil Himself. This doctrine is so confusing many people can&rsquo;t actually understand it nor explain it. The best explanations some can come up with is likening it unto water, they&rsquo;ll often say things like, &ldquo;think of it like water, it can be a gas, a vapour or a solid&rdquo;. However, the problem is once people read the bible they realise a major problem with this doctrine. If God the Father sits in heaven, how can Jesus be seated to the right of Him if they are one being? How could the Father speak from heaven, whilst Jesus is getting baptised and the Holy Spirit is descending? The reason for this study is because there is a sinister plan behind this teaching, one which will have worldwide implications for the masses who choose the lies of Satan over the undefiled word of God.</p>

<p>First of all, let&rsquo;s look at Genesis 1:1 &ldquo;In the beginning <strong><u>God created</u></strong> the heaven and the earth&rdquo;. The word God here comes from the Hebrew word elohiym, according to strong&rsquo;s H430, the word means &ldquo;Gods&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s actually the plural form of the word elowahh, which means &ldquo;God&rdquo;. This means in the beginning there was more than one God there in creation. Can we confirm this?</p>

<p>In John 1:1 it reads; <strong>&ldquo;</strong>In the beginning was <strong><u>the Word,</u></strong> and the <strong><u>Word was with God</u></strong>, and the <strong><u>Word was God</u></strong>.<strong><u>The same was</u></strong> in the beginning <strong><u>with God</u></strong>. <strong><u>All things were made by Him</u></strong>; and without Him was not any thing made that was made.&rdquo; We are plainly told that in the beginning, the Lord Jesus was there, and He was with God (The Father), and not only was He with God, but at the same time He was also God. How do we know this verse refers to Jesus? John 1:14 &ldquo;<strong><u>and the word was made flesh</u></strong> and dwelt among us&hellip;&rdquo; The only God in the Godhead who was made flesh and dwelt among us was Jesus. The Father and the Holy Spirit were not made flesh and did not dwell among us. Jesus &nbsp;&ldquo;came unto his own, and his own received Him not&rdquo; John 1:11. His own being the Jews.</p>

<p>This means in creation week, all three Gods were there, coexisting each with their own person, however all working with one accord, in fact Jesus actually tells God the Father and The Holy Spirit; Genesis 1:26 &ldquo;And God said,&nbsp;<strong>Let</strong>&nbsp;<strong>us</strong>&nbsp;<strong>make</strong>&nbsp;<strong>man</strong>&nbsp;in <strong><u>our image</u></strong>, after <strong><u>our likeness</u></strong>&hellip;&rdquo; did you catch that? He actually says &ldquo;our image&rdquo; and &ldquo;our likeness&rdquo;, this also tells us that all three Gods look the same. Can we prove this?</p>

<p>In Daniel chapter 7 when given a description of God the Father, we read &ldquo;I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and <strong><u>the hair of his head like the pure wool:</u></strong> his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.&rdquo; Daniel 7:9. God has hair like pure wool, indicating white hair. In verse 13 Daniel sees Jesus coming towards God the Father &ldquo;I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the <strong><u>Son of man</u></strong> (Jesus) came with the clouds of heaven, <strong><u>and came to the Ancient of days</u></strong>, and they brought Him near <strong><u>before Him</u></strong>.&rdquo; If there is one being, how can the Son be brought BEFORE the Father, if they are meant to be one deity? Now although Jesus has already given us enough information to know what God the Father looks like by saying &ldquo;our likeness&rdquo; let&rsquo;s see what Jesus looks like does he also have the same hair?</p>

<p>Revelation 1:13-15 &ldquo;And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the <strong><u>Son of man</u></strong> (Jesus), clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle. <strong><u>His head and his hairs were white like wool</u></strong>, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.&rdquo; We also read in revelation chapter 1 the same hair like wool that the Father has.</p>
<p>Can we also confirm that the Holy Spirit looks like Jesus? One of the names of the Holy Spirit is Melchisedec (see the who is Melchisedec study for more information). Using this information in Hebrews 7:3 we are told he is &ldquo;<strong><u>Without father, without mother, without descent</u></strong>, having <strong><u>neither beginning of days</u></strong>, <strong><u>nor end of life</u></strong>; but <strong><u>made like unto the Son of God</u></strong>; abideth a priest continually.&rdquo; The Holy Spirit is &ldquo;<strong><u>made</u></strong> like unto the son of God&rdquo; meaning he has the exact same form, and we know the word &ldquo;made&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t imply he was created, because the verse says he has &ldquo;<strong><u>neither beginning of days</u></strong>, <strong><u>nor end of life&rdquo; </u></strong>he is eternal.</p>

<p>There are many verses which indeed show that there are three Gods, but they work in one accord. &nbsp;Luke 3:22 &ldquo;And <strong><u>the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape</u></strong> like a dove upon Him, and <strong><u>a voice came from heaven</u></strong>, which said, Thou art <strong><u>my beloved Son</u></strong>; in thee I am well pleased.&rdquo; In literally one verse we have God the Father in Heaven, the Holy Spirit descending &ldquo;in a <strong><u>BODILY</u></strong> shape like a dove&rdquo; and Jesus standing in the water. How is it possible to say there is only one God? when clearly three of them are in three different places at the same time? In fact on the mount of transfiguration God the Father once again says &ldquo;&hellip;<strong>This</strong>&nbsp;<strong>is</strong>&nbsp;<strong>my</strong>&nbsp;<strong>beloved</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Son</strong>, in whom I am well pleased; <strong><u>hear ye Him</u></strong>.&rdquo; Matthew 17:5. This hands down proves that they are three separate beings but work in one accord. They have their own persons and personalities but work together as one.</p>

<p>It can be no clearer than 1 John 5:7 &ldquo;For <strong><u>there are three that bear record in heaven</u></strong>, <strong><u>the Father</u></strong>, <strong><u>the Word, and the Holy Ghost</u></strong>: and these three are one.&rdquo; Now even though this verse is crystal clear that there are three that bear record in heaven, some will try to twist the phase &ldquo;these three are one&rdquo; in order to hold on to their one God theology. However, in this context this just means that they agree or are in unity. The same way Genesis 2:24 reads &ldquo;<strong>Therefore</strong>&nbsp;<strong>shall</strong>&nbsp;<strong>a</strong>&nbsp;<strong>man</strong>&nbsp;leave his father&nbsp;and his mother,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><u>shall&nbsp;cleave unto his wife</u></strong>:&nbsp;and they&nbsp;shall&nbsp;be <strong><u>one flesh</u></strong>.&rdquo; The verse isn&rsquo;t saying the husband and wife become one human blob, clearly not. The husband has his own personality and so does the wife but they work together as one.</p>

<p>The evidence is overwhelming when it comes to proving that the Godhead consists of three Gods each with their own mind and body. In fact we see what The Father says to the Son in Hebrews 1:8-9 &ldquo;<strong><sup>&nbsp;</sup></strong>But <strong><u>unto the Son he saith</u></strong>, <strong><u>Thy throne, O God</u></strong>, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; <strong><u>therefore God</u></strong>, <strong><u>even thy God </u></strong><u>(Holy Spirit)</u>, <strong><u>hath anointed thee</u></strong> with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.&rdquo; This verse should put the nail in coffin on the one God theology. God the Father calls his son &ldquo;God&rdquo; and calls the Holy Spirit &ldquo;God&rdquo;. Wasn&rsquo;t it the Holy Spirit who anointed Jesus? Luke 4:18 &ldquo; The <strong><u>Spirit of the Lord </u></strong>is upon me, because <strong><u>he </u></strong>(Holy Spirit) <strong><u>hath&nbsp;anointed&nbsp;me</u></strong> to preach the gospel to the poor&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>So how did this lie get started? By twisting verses out of context Satan can make it look like new doctrine when really it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;doctrine of devils&rdquo; James 2:19 &ldquo;Thou believest that there is&nbsp;<strong><u>one&nbsp;God</u></strong>; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.&rdquo; When studying the bible &ldquo;precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line, here a little and there a little&rdquo; Isaiah 28:10. After reading all the verses clearly indicating there are three Gods, how do you now rectify this verse? Well let&rsquo;s use the &ldquo;here a little and there a little&rdquo; principle, is there another verse which uses the same language? 1 Corinthians 8:6 &ldquo;<strong><sup>&nbsp;</sup></strong>But to us <strong><u>there is but one God, the Father</u></strong>, of whom are all things, and we in Him; <strong><u>and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things</u></strong>, and we by Him&rdquo; Because this verse says there is &ldquo;but one God, the Father&rdquo; does it mean that Jesus Christ isn&rsquo;t a God? Our Lord and saviour who God the Father calls &ldquo;God&rdquo;? &ldquo;Who (Jesus), being in the <strong><u>form of</u></strong> <strong><u>God</u></strong>,&nbsp;thought&nbsp;it&nbsp;not&nbsp;robbery&nbsp;to be <strong><u>equal with God</u></strong>&rdquo;? Philippians 2:6. Clearly James 2:19 is referring to only the Father in that context as we know Jesus is also a God. It can be no clearer than Hebrews 1:8-9 &ldquo;<strong><sup>&nbsp;</sup></strong>But <strong><u>unto the Son he saith</u></strong>, <strong><u>Thy throne, </u></strong><strong><u>O God&rdquo;.&nbsp; </u></strong>Using scriptures in harmony with each other we can plainly see when the bible says &ldquo;one God&rdquo; (which it only does on a few occasions) it&rsquo;s referring to The Father, 1 timothy 2:5 &ldquo;For <strong><u>there is one God</u></strong>, <strong>and</strong> <strong><u>one mediator between God and men</u></strong>, the man <strong><u>Christ Jesus</u></strong>&rdquo; does 1 timothy 2:5 imply Jesus isn&rsquo;t God? No! why? Because even the Father calls Him &ldquo;God&rdquo;! Hebrews 1:8-9 &ldquo;<strong><sup>&nbsp;</sup></strong>But <strong><u>unto </u></strong><strong><u>the Son he saith</u></strong>, <strong><u>Thy throne, </u></strong><strong><u>O God&rdquo;.&nbsp; </u></strong></p>

<p>At the second coming we will see Jesus, and God the Father. When the last plague falls and the eastern sky splits, look at who the wicked will seek protection from. Revelation 6:16 &ldquo;And said to&nbsp;<strong>the</strong>&nbsp;mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from&nbsp;<strong><u>the&nbsp;face of Him that sitteth on&nbsp;the&nbsp;throne</u></strong><u>,</u> <strong><u>and</u></strong><strong><u> from&nbsp;the&nbsp;wrath of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Lamb</u></strong>&rdquo; They want to be hidden from not just the Lamb of God, being Jesus, but also Him that sitteth on the throne! Who sits on the throne? Daniel 7:9 &ldquo;I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days <strong><u>did sit&hellip;</u></strong>&rdquo; Not only that but notice who else comes to end the kingdom of antichrist? Daniel 7:21-22&nbsp; &ldquo;I beheld, <strong><u>and the same horn made war</u></strong> with the saints, and prevailed against them; <strong><u>Until the Ancient of days came</u></strong>, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So why did Satan create this lie? Well if everyone is looking to see one being at the second coming, what better way to &ldquo;deceive the very elect&rdquo;, than to impersonate Christ Himself! 2 Corinthians 11:14 &ldquo;And&nbsp;<strong>no</strong>&nbsp;<strong>marvel</strong>; for <strong><u>Satan Himself is transformed into an angel of light</u></strong>.&rdquo; Notice what happens before Jesus comes back 2 Thessalonians 8-9 &ldquo;And then <strong><u>shall that Wicked be revealed</u></strong>, <strong><u>whom the Lord shall consume</u></strong> with the spirit of his mouth, and <strong><u>shall destroy with the brightness of his coming</u></strong>: Even Him, <strong><u>whose coming is </u></strong><strong><u>after</u></strong><strong><u> the working of Satan with all power and signs</u></strong> and lying wonders&rdquo; Notice that Jesus comes to consume the antichrist, BUT THIS IS ONLY AFTER SATAN HAS COME WITH ALL POWER AND SIGNS! Now do you see why Satan introduced this lie? It was so that when he masquerades as Jesus Christ, many will be deceived by Him and believe his lies over the truth. Do you also see why lately there have been more films about a coming messiah?</p>

<p>Luckily thanks to our God, we know that he will protect his elect from this great deception and they will not be deceived, so the dying god of this world, can play his games, but he knows his sentence, Isaiah 14:12-15<strong> &ldquo;</strong>How art thou fallen from heaven<strong><u>, O Lucifer</u></strong>, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!<strong><sup>&nbsp;</sup></strong>For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:<strong><sup>&nbsp;</sup></strong>I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High. <strong><u>Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell</u></strong>, to the sides of the pit.&rdquo; the Lord has already won. Satan knows Hebrews 10:31&ldquo;<strong><u>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;fearful&nbsp;thing to fall into the hands of the living God&rdquo;. </u></strong>Satan is well aware of how powerful our God is and &ldquo;&hellip;<strong>he</strong>&nbsp;knoweth that&nbsp;<strong>he</strong>&nbsp;<strong>hath</strong>&nbsp;<strong>but</strong>&nbsp;<strong>a</strong>&nbsp;<strong>short</strong>&nbsp;time&rdquo; Revelation 12:12, so stay in your word and pray daily. Maranatha!</p>
